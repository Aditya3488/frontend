What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating web pages. It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content. In layman's terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house.

In a nutshell:

1) HTML is the language of the web, used to create websites.
2) HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet.
3) HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files typically have either a ".html" or ".htm" extension.
4) There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version.

Features of HTML:

1) It is platform-independent. For example, Chrome displays the same pages identically across different operating systems such as Mac, Linux, and Windows.
2) Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page (For example - YouTube shows videos on their website)
3) HTML is a markup language and not a programming language.
4) It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc. to show interactive (or dynamic) web pages


Why the Term HyperText & Markup Language?
The term 'Hypertext Markup Language' is composed of two main words: 'hypertext' and 'markup language.' 'Hypertext' refers to the linking of text with other documents, while 'markup language' denotes a language that utilizes a specific set of tags.

Thus, HTML is the practice of displaying text, graphics, audio, video etc. in a certain way using special tags.

Note: Tags are meaningful texts enclosed in angle braces, like '<...>'. For example, the '<head>' tag. Each tag has a unique meaning and significance in building an HTML page, and it can influence the web page in various ways.
